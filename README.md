## Introduction

This repository contains code implementations of networking concepts such as:
- Socket programming (TCP and UDP)
- DNS Lookup
- HTTP Request Simulation
- Chat application using sockets
- Client-Server architecture
- Network layer algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, Distance Vector)
- Protocol simulation (e.g., ARP, ICMP, etc.)

These assignments are designed for educational purposes and follow the typical Computer Networks syllabus in undergraduate courses.
